# Predict-Yellow-NYC
This is final project of Coursera Specialization "Machine Learning and Data Analysis"

Goal this project is predict number of taxi in the next hour.


- [Week 1](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%201/NY%20yellow%20taxi.ipynb). In the first week, raw data must be processed. Preprocess function I put in a different [file](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%201/Create%20data.ipynb)
- [Week 2](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%202/Geo%20taxi.ipynb). This week you will learn how to work with geodata, learn how to draw objects on statistical and dynamic maps, and understand what rectangular areas you really need to forecast cab demand for
- [Week 3](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%203/Predict%20time%20analysis.ipynb). Now it's time to move on to building models! Let's start with building so-called baselines - let's build some models, which we will later use as a first approximation for the future model. Often linear models are used to solve similar problems, as well as ensembles, e.g. random forest or gradient boosting
- [Week 4](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%204/Predicting%20a%20lot%20of%20series.ipynb). This week, we will build such forecasts for each zone. To avoid manually picking up a huge number of models, you will need to cluster the rows.
- [Week 5](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%205/C6W5.ipynb). The ARIMA class of models is not rich enough for our data: with their help, for example, it is impossible to take into account the relationships between the rows. We need a more complex model. Let us reduce the problem of mass series prediction to the regression formulation
- [Week 6](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/blob/main/week%206/New%20features.ipynb). This week you are going to try to add more traits to your regression model. Let your imagination run wild!
- [Week 7](https://github.com/Nickolays/Predict-Yellow-NYC/tree/main/week%207). This week you will have to design the result using interactive charts.
